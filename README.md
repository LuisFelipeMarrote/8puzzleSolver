# 8puzzleSolver
This is an application made with Python to solve every game of 8 puzzle, if it's solvable.  
It uses an algorithm called A*, similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but it only finds the shortest-path to the goal unlike Dijkstra that finds all the shortest-path tree from a specified location to all possible goals. 
Which means, the output will be the shortest sequence of moves to solve a specific game.
